# weather

Simple weather app that fetch your current location or you can search with the name of city and
it will showcase the current temperature.

Please makesure to use your own api from openweather..


Summary:

1. Async and await keyword is very important since it allow functions to fetch data from external apis
2. Openweather API has been used.. it's free ;)
3. Makesure to checkout comments.

Lastly I built this project by watching tutorial so this isn't a original project. It's just for my learning purpose.
